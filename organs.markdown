It is unimaginable to think that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook or Jeff Bezos of Amazon would be unable to obtain new organs if they fell ill. Although organ trading is officially illegal in all jurisdictions besides Iran, the illicit global organ trading market is conservatively valued at $600 million to $1.2 billion per year. Human lifespans have gradually and steadily been increasing, including futurists proclaiming that some of presently living humans will live up to 200 years of age, which naturally will lead to an increase in demand for organs.

In an era of deregulation and legalization of previously illicit industries (sex work, cannabis, etc.), the repeal of the prohibition of organ trading is more likely than ever, and calls for the legalization appear periodically in mainstream media, ranging from TIME to the Atlantic. We can be certain that, as soon as organs become a commodity, a host of tradable securities will be created on their basis. Once people gain the right to sell their organs, they gain the right to get paid now for the future transaction, whether it occurs during or after their lives. We have imagined a contract allowing an individual to sell the rights for the future use of their organs, thus enabling them to profit from value that in most cases can only be extracted upon their death. 

This contract, much like a stock option contract, may then be traded among third parties and eventually increase or decrease in value based on the market’s perception of the underlying person’s chance of yielding their organs soon, and in a healthy and usable state. For example, the contract of a young person with a job or hobbies involving higher than average mortality rates may increase in value, whereas the value of a contract pertaining to the organs of an ageing, sedentary person might tend to decrease. We are creating a computational model to provide this information to investors.
