*Making money is art -- Andy Warhol*

The art market has consistently outperformed the equity and commodities markets, representing a means for maximizing profits while supporting culture. Whether you are an investor looking for a competitive edge or an artist looking to capitalize on your creations, Demeteris Art SharesⓇ are the solution.

Art investment funds currently issue and sell shares in portfolios of artwork by reputable “blue chip” artists. We cut out the middle man, and create a platform for savvy art investors to directly purchase shares in the art they love and even the artists they believe in. Just like a shareholder of a corporation, you will receive a proportional distribution of the profits made by the artist in the form of a dividend. And if you pick the right investment, you could see the value of your shares rise exponentially. 

All of the shares will be purchased and traded on our blockchain enabled online exchange, which guarantees accurate pricing, easy transacting, and secure recording of ownership. In other words, the art -- and in some cases, the artist -- will be securitized. At our sales booth in your festival, we will create a live marketplace for the art that you have curated by issuing shares and promoting their purchase among the audience.

**What Is Art?**

Our work is inspired by contemporary artworks that defy the conceptual boundaries between art and financial securities. Most notably, American artist and law professor Brian Frye recently sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, requesting that the regulatory body take administrative action against his issuance of unregulated securities, while simultaneously issuing ownership shares in this performance to the general public. 

In *SEC No-Action Letter*, Frye attempted to convince the United States Government to recognize a performance art piece as a security. With Demeteris Art Shares, we are attempting to convince art festival curators, participants, and attendees that creating and promoting a market for the trade of financial securities within an art festival is a potentially valid form of artistic performance.

The definition of art remains elusive, the most simple being that anything that can be sold on the art market is art. Art must therefore have an objective economic value. But it must also have at least a subjective conceptual and esthetic value, derived from its ability to provoke thought and emotion in those that experience it. Without this subjective element, anything--from stocks, to commodities, to real estate--could be sold on the art market.

Until our securities are traded on the art market, they are not art--unless the subjective esthetic value of our performance is otherwise recognized, such as you accepting our project for presentation at your art festival.  

**Securitization of Art as the Final Step in Abstraction**

Broadly considered, art has since the Renaissance followed a path from physical representation towards conceptual abstraction. The process of abstraction of art has occurred in art's esthetic, conceptual, legal, and economic dimensions. 

From Sol LeWitt's wall paintings to Maurizio Cattelan's infamous banana, the economic and legal value of many conceptual works can only be represented by an accompanying certificate of ownership, because the physical manifestation of the art is temporary, economically worthless, and infinitely reproducible. The esthetic and conceptual value of these works exist primarily as an idea hatched by their creator, represented by physical objects that the audience can experience over and over again.

In our project, the economic value of the art is anchored in a certificate as well, but unlike LeWitt and Cattelan's works, the esthetic and conceptual value of the work is dissociated from any tangible object. We propose that, just like its legal and economic value, the esthetic and conceptual value of an artwork can potentially be transmuted into certificates. The abstraction is thus complete. 

The artistic value of our work is derived from the creation and marketing of token's of economic value--securities--not on a formal exchange, but at an art festival. Drawing attention to the bizarre conceptual tensions between art and finance, we hope to engage you, your audience, and the other artists to join us in performing capitalism with us on our securities exchange. 

We also believe our project also has value from a a practical and economic standpoint. A growing problem for performance and conceptual artists is the sale of their intangible works--a problem that is solved by creating blockchain tokens for the ownership of the artist’s past, present, and future performances.
