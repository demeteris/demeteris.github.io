Demeteris Securities is a conceptual investment corporation that reveals the inner working and fatal consequences of the uncharted frontier of capitalism. Challenging the already blurry lines between the art and business worlds, the project revolves around the creation and sale of crypto-securities that encourage speculation on peopleâ€™s inherent value. Our mock corporation will purchase from volunteers (including the audience and through an open call) the right to future use of their organs and digital identities, package these contractual rights into tradable securities, and then offer them for sale. By performing and precipitating this final wave of commoditization, we expose the absurd reality of our failing financial, economic, and social systems.
