Challenging the already blurry lines between the art and business worlds, Demeteris Securities  designs and builds crypto-securities markets that encourage speculation on peopleâ€™s inherent value. Our goal is to create working marketplaces that reveal to your audiences the inner workings and fatal consequences of the uncharted frontier of capitalism.

Our mock corporation will purchase from volunteers (among audience members and an online open call) the right to future use of their organs and digital identities, package these contractual rights into tradable securities, and then offer them for sale. We are also developing an art investment platform enabling festival goers to speculate on artists and their works.  

By performing and precipitating this final wave of commoditization, we expose the absurd reality of our failing financial, economic, and social systems. Participants in our securities exchanges -- both on the issuing and purchasing end -- will learn about their own ethical standards and how flexible they become in the face of potential profits.
