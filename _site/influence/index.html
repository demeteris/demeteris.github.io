    <p>The digital identities captured in data are central to capitalism’s final stage. Every single individual on the planet who is connected to the Internet has a unique and extensive profile, reflecting their browsing, chatting, and purchasing histories. These profiles are already traded by data brokers, and purchased by companies seeking to increase the accuracy of their advertisement targeting. Efforts are already being made to allow individuals to act as their own data brokers, but for now the profits available to individuals remain minimal, since the value of personal data is amplified when in the aggregate.</p>

<p><strong>Open Marketplace for Online Influence</strong></p>

<p>Demeteris Securities attempts to create an open marketplace for bidding on the value of a person’s online influence through data relating to their personal characteristics and social networks. Social influencers abound on various online platforms, and corporations are already paying large sums to create organic reach via advertisement masquerading as genuine content. We foresee a future way for them to further monetize and leverage their online clout. Anyone - certified influencer or not - may sell to companies the rights to use their online handles after their death, or the right to request a given number of posts or endorsements during life. This latter option recalls how billionaire mayor Mike Bloomberg paid young influencers to make favorable <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Instagram</em> posts about him.</p>

<p>We imagine these long term use and endorsement contracts to be securitized through third party trading. Contracts relating to influencers whose network and fanbase is increasing will of course become more valuable over time. On the other hand, contracts for the rights to make posts on the accounts of individuals whose influence is waning will decrease in value. By obtaining the influencer’s consent at the time of the contract execution, we can track the ups and downs of their social standing, which are directly provided to investors.</p>

<p>We have already begun to purchase the rights to use of social media handles and organs of willing volunteers for this experiment in post-capitalism. We have conceived advertisements and a sales booth to set up at the art festival, where we will pitch these <em>Securitized Contract Certificates (SCC)</em> to your visitors, who will become the first investors in this new era of capitalism. We will create an online exchange for these certificates, complete with detailed information regarding their underlying commodities - people. Trading on this online exchange and also between individual investors will determine the value of the certificates over time.</p>
