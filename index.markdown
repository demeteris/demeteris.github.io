In a time of reduced economic opportunities, ultra high unemployment, and increased market fragility, we anticipate that the capitalist system will attempt to impose itself in all areas of life, including those that were hitherto off limits to commerce. Demeteris Securities is born out of critical research into the current state of market capitalism, and provides new ways to expand your wealth.

In particular, three advanced investment vehicles are developed: [Art Sharesâ“‡]({% link artshares.markdown %}), [Organ Futures]({% link organs.markdown %}), and [Influence Derivatives]({% link influence.markdown %}). These products leverage the rapidly changing landscape of market conditions. While understanding inherent risks, we maximize the benefits of our clients
