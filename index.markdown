In a time of reduced economic opportunities, ultra high unemployment, and increased market fragility, we anticipate that the capitalist system will attempt to impose itself in all areas of life, including those that were hitherto off limits to commerce. We present and perform this near-future post capitalistic venture in earnest. Demeteris Securities is born out of critical research into the current state of market capitalism. We are developing three advanced investment vehicles for the future generation: organs, social profiles, and art shares.
